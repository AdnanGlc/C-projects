# Pathfinfing-visualizer


This project is a Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer built in C#, designed to demonstrate how different pathfinding algorithms work in real-time. It includes various algorithms, a maze generator, and interactive controls for obstacle placement and speed adjustment.


Features

Pathfinding Algorithms:

  BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  Bidirectional BFS
  A (A-star) Algorithm*
  Greedy Best-First Search
  Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm
Maze Generation:
  Automatic generation of mazes to test algorithms.
Interactive Controls:
  Draw obstacles using the mouse.
  Adjust visualization speed dynamically.
  Set start and end points manually.
